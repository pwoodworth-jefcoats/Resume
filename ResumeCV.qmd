Kaneohe, HI  |  <phoebe.jefcoats@gmail.com>  
[pwj-dataviz.com](https://www.pwj-dataviz.com)  |  GitHub: [pwoodworth-jefcoats](https://github.com/pwoodworth-jefcoats)  |  ORCiD: [0000-0001-9353-923X](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9353-923X)  

## Professional Summary
I have over 20 years of experience turning large datasets into easy-to-understand
graphics and reports, all backed by thorough data analysis.  I'm adept at workflows
that merge data analysis and communication product development, including incorporating
branding standards.  Across my work, I focus on using data to provide clarity, tell
stories, and inform decisions for audiences ranging from technical experts to casual
readers.  I embrace collaborative open science and contribute to the development of
tools, templates, best practice guides, and hands-on training.

## My Career Evolution

The focus of my work has changed over time, shifting from data analysis to subject matter expertise. I've also expanded into teaching roles, including instruction and data visualization. @cr-role-evolve

I'm looking to continue on this trajectory; using 
my expertise, teaching abilities, data visualization skills to contribute directly to 
climate solutions.

:::{#cr-role-evolve}
```{r}
library(ggbump)
library(cowplot) # for plotting aesthetics

# colors from scale_color_paletteer_d("PrettyCols::Bold"), but reordered

pub_roles <- Products |>

  geom_bump(aes(color = Role), linewidth = 1, smooth = 7,
            data = ~. |> filter(Role != "Data Analysis"), 
            show.legend = FALSE) + 
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#679C35", "#CD1076","#6497B1","#6A359C")) +
  # To address overplotting
  geom_bump(color = "#FFB04F", linetype = 1, linewidth = 1, smooth = 7,
            data = ~. |> filter(Role == "Data Analysis")) +
